                        <div class="course-des-content"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone are the days when only one programming language or a very specific process was required from a developer. Nowadays programmers must know a range of technologies across multiple platforms in order to do good work.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-stack developer doesn't need to master all of the areas and technologies he needs to work it, because that just makes it nearly impossible, he just needs to be comfortable working with those technologies, and that's a lot too.</p>.

                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's more about having an understanding in each of the areas above, to communicate intelligently between team members and to be a good asset if the situation needs it</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-stack developer will have an increasingly important role in the web development of the future, especially when development methods such as DevOps are becoming an essential part of software development companies, where the line between code developers and administrators who are responsible for code deployment and setup is getting thinner each day.</p>
